# Panic-Buying
A Windows Form application written in C# with .NET framework. The program is written to simulate the act of panic buying -  the act of buying large amounts of a product in anticipation of an emergency. The most recent example is the shortage of items such as face masks, food, bottled water, milk, and toilet paper in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. To avoid this problem, a local grocery store has adopted the following policy for certain items. For an item with cost C, the client will pay C dollars for the first unit purchased, 2×C dollars for the second unit purchased, 3×C dollars for the third unit purchased, and so on. Thus, a client must pay i×C dollars for the i-th unit purchased. If a client must buy N units of an item with cost C and has D dollars in his wallet, will the client have enough money? If not, how many extra dollars will the client need to complete this purchase?
